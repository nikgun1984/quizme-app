# quizme-app

The purpose of the following application is learning English words by playing games,
creating quizes and internalize those words by doing different activities. Going ahead
it should not to be necessarily limited to english language but can be later extended to different subcategories 
like learning science/math/biology/preparing for exam and creating flashcards for any class etc. There are 
so many ideas but I am working on something simple for now. 

This is a backend of the following application.  
Technologies used:  
- Node.js
- Express.js. 
- PostgreSQL. 
- Heroku. 
- Bcrypt. 
- JsonSchema for checking the data for potential input errors.
